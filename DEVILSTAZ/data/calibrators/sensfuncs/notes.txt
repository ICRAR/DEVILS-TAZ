How to add FITS files to the repository

From https://svn.mso.anu.edu.au/commit_rejects.php

To fix, remove it from the list of files to be added and recommit or,
if it absolutely must be version controlled as named, use one of the
following bypass mechanisms to add the file to the repository: 

add a property named 'bypass:junk-filter' (without quotes) to the
offending file(s) and re-commit; there is no need to remove the
property afterwards (although you can if you wish) 

svn-rename the file to append ".BYPASS_JUNK_FILTER" to the end of the
filename (after any existing extension) and re-commit; afterwards, you
will likely want to svn-rename again to remove the bypass extension,
then re-commit

svn add AAOMEGA-2DF_X5700_385R_E2V3A.fits
svn propset bypass:junk-filter on AAOMEGA-2DF_X5700_385R_E2V3A.fits
svn commit AAOMEGA-2DF_X5700_385R_E2V3A.fits -m "bla bla"
